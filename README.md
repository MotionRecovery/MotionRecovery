## Thanks

Many thanks to Professor Bruno Dumas for his course on embodied and augmented interfaces, it allowed us to learn a lot about this area. Thanks also to Maxime André, who was our assistant for this course, who gave us valuable advice for the development of this project.

## Troubleshooting

- **The kinect doesn't recognize me:** Check that the kinect is turned on and connected, normally if the kinect is not connected a message will appear on the exercise page to tell you this. It is also possible that your exercise environment is not suitable, if for example you are dressed in black and the background is also black. If you wear loose clothing, the Kinect may recognize you but less well.

- **Angle problem:** The kinect will always have a margin of error when it comes to angle recognition, which is related to recognizing which parts of the body have defects. It is common to have a margin of error of 10°, for example when we bend our elbow 90° upwards, it is possible that the kinect recognizes 100°.
